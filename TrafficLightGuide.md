# Traffic Light Task System - Quick Reference

## 🚦 Task Status Colors

Your TASKS.md file now uses an intuitive **traffic light system** for tracking task progress:

### Color Legend

| Status | Symbol | Meaning | When to Use | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Not Started** | 🔴 | Task hasn't been started yet | Initial state of all tasks | `🔴 Create Card interface` |
| **In Progress** | 🟡 | Task is actively being worked on | When you begin a task | `🟡 Create Card interface` |
| **Completed** | 🟢 | Task is finished | When task is done (add date) | `🟢 Create Card interface (Completed: 2025-10-19)` |
| **Blocked** | ⚫ | Task can't proceed | When waiting on something | `⚫ Deploy to production (waiting for API keys)` |
| **Needs Info** | ⚪ | Task needs clarification | When requirements unclear | `⚪ Add animations (which animations?)` |

## 📝 How to Update Tasks

### Starting a Task
```markdown
# Before
- 🔴 Implement card flip animation

# After (when you start working on it)
- 🟡 Implement card flip animation
```

### Completing a Task
```markdown
# Before
- 🟡 Implement card flip animation

# After (when finished - ALWAYS add date)
- 🟢 Implement card flip animation (Completed: 2025-10-19)
```

### Adding a New Task
```markdown
# Add to appropriate section with red circle and priority
- 🔴 Add sound effects for card flip [MEDIUM]
  - Related to: Animation System
  - Estimated effort: Small
```

### Blocking a Task
```markdown
# When task can't proceed
- ⚫ Set up production server (waiting for hosting account approval)
```

### Requesting Clarification
```markdown
# When requirements are unclear
- ⚪ Add card animations (need to know: which animations? duration? timing?)
```

## 🎯 Visual Progress at a Glance

The traffic light system makes it easy to see project status instantly:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Core Card System

### Card Models [HIGH]
- 🟢 Create Card interface (Completed: 2025-10-15)
- 🟢 Create Deck class (Completed: 2025-10-16)
- 🟡 Test card/deck logic
  - 🟢 Unit tests for Card utilities (Completed: 2025-10-17)
  - 🟡 Unit tests for Deck class
  - 🔴 Test shuffle randomness
  - 🔴 Test edge cases
```

**Quick scan shows:**
- ✅ 2 major tasks completed (green)
- 🏗️ 2 tasks in progress (yellow)
- 📋 2 tasks not started (red)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Update Immediately**
Change the circle color as soon as you change status:
- Start task → Change 🔴 to 🟡
- Finish task → Change 🟡 to 🟢 + add date

### 2. **Use Subtasks**
Break down complex tasks:
```markdown
- 🟡 Create drag-and-drop system
  - 🟢 Mouse events (Completed: 2025-10-19)
  - 🟡 Touch events
  - 🔴 Keyboard support
```

### 3. **Priority Levels**
Tasks also have priority indicators:
- `[HIGH]` - Critical path items
- `[MEDIUM]` - Important but not blocking
- `[LOW]` - Nice to have features

### 4. **Progress Tracking**
Phase completion uses the same system:
```markdown
### Phase Completion
- 🟢 Phase 0: Setup & Foundation (100%)
- 🟡 Phase 1: Core Card System (45%)
- 🔴 Phase 2: Freeform Play Mode (0%)
```

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Daily Standup View
Quickly see what's happening:
```markdown
Yesterday: 🟢 (completed tasks)
Today: 🟡 (in progress tasks)
Blockers: ⚫ (blocked tasks)
```

### Sprint Planning
Identify available work:
```markdown
Ready to Start: 🔴 (not started, no blockers)
In Flight: 🟡 (currently being worked)
Done: 🟢 (completed this sprint)
```

### Code Review
Check task completion:
```markdown
All subtasks green? ✅ Ready for review
Any yellow/red? ⏳ Still in progress
Any black? 🚫 Blocked, can't merge
```
